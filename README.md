About Me 👋
Hi there! I'm a seasoned developer with a background in backend management, website security, and server administration. Over the years, my journey has evolved, and so has my perspective on cybersecurity.

My Realization 💡

In the past, I believed that to defend, one must first know how to attack. This mindset led me to find vulnerabilities and learn how to exploit systems. While this approach gave me valuable insights, I now realize that it was an irresponsible way to contribute to the field of cybersecurity.

My New Focus 🔒

Today, my goal is to "defend by understanding, knowledge, and history." I am committed to using my skills to predict and protect against potential risks. I leverage AI to help safeguard systems, enhance security practices, and foster a safer digital environment.

Vision for a Better Tomorrow 🌍

I am passionate about spreading knowledge and encouraging responsibility in the tech community. This GitHub is a reflection of my commitment to doing things the right way, sharing my projects, and learning together as a community.

People don't change overnight, and my journey is a testament to that. Join me in my mission to build a more secure and responsible future for everyone.
